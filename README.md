Scheme implementation in Haskell.

My tool for teaching myself Haskell and various programming language stuff (compilers, macros, continuations, etc.). In time I will organize and document things to make this more useful to others.

If you are looking for a real Scheme implementation in Haskell, look at (Husk)[http://justinethier.github.io/husk-scheme/], also based on the same tutorial I used.

Based on http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours and exercises already implemented. I do not claim credit for the majority of this project.

TODO:
 - Compile into native code with LLVM
 - Continuations.
 - Implement macros.
